> Hey, I am Vasiliy Zubarev, Skoltech MSc student.

I think that clear workspace and reproducible workflow are extremely important for scientist.
This is the reason why I joined "Workspace and workflow management in biology" course.
There are materials from our lectures and discussions, which can be useful to many scientists.

Lecture notes are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQKybmzmNV8p-q47-PsmUm-75UWG3vLizrWyo09gxSQ/edit?usp=sharing

If you have a question or advice about these materials, don't hesitate to contact me!
